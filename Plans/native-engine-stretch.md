# Native Engine — Stretch Items from Completed Plan

**Status:** In Progress (code complete 2026-04-28; manual live parity gate pending)
**Created:** 2026-04-24
**Goal:** Implement the three deferred items the `native-controller-dll.md` plan called out as out-of-scope when it was marked complete on 2026-04-23.

## Context

The completed plan `Plans/Completed/native-controller-dll.md` shipped a working C# WinForms app (`MacrosApp/`) backed by a native C engine (`MacrosEngine/`). The 2026-04-24 debug session confirmed:

- `MacrosEngine/build-x64/test_engine.exe` passes 48/48 native tests.
- `MacrosApp/tools/MacrosApp.Smoke` passes the full record→persist→playback→Idle round-trip.
- `MacrosApp.exe` Debug build is current (rebuilt 2026-04-22).

Three items in the original plan's "Deferred" list are now eligible for follow-up work:

1. **Controller event recording in the engine** — `xinput_poller.c` does not yet emit `EVENT_CONTROLLER` records into `event_recorder.c`'s circular buffer. C# UI never sees controller events back from the engine.
2. **vJoy playback** — `MacrosEngine/src/event_player.c:163` drops `EVENT_CONTROLLER` events at playback time with `OutputDebugStringA("MacrosEngine: EVENT_CONTROLLER skipped (vJoy not implemented)\n")`.
3. **Playback-thread shutdown hardening** — current shutdown still relies on `TerminateThread` timeout fallback per the completed plan's note. Should be replaced with a cooperative cancellation event.

## Implementation Update — 2026-04-28

- E1, E2, and E3 are implemented in the native engine and MacrosApp wrapper.
- Automated verification now covers controller event recording/injection, controller event file round-trip, long playback cancellation, optional vJoy state/playback, app build, and the WinForms smoke record→persist→playback→Idle flow.
- Verified commands: `MacrosEngine/build-x64/test_engine.exe` passed 66/66, `dotnet build MacrosApp/MacrosApp/MacrosApp.csproj` passed with 0 warnings/errors, and `dotnet run --project MacrosApp/tools/MacrosApp.Smoke/MacrosApp.Smoke.csproj` passed with 6 saved events and final Idle state.
- vJoy was available and ready on the test machine during the native vJoy API test. No live controller was connected during the automated controller polling sample.
- Remaining work is the live parity gate: exercise a real mixed keyboard + mouse + controller recording through MacrosApp, verify vJoy output in `joy.cpl`, and compare against AHK v1 behavior on real hardware.

## Remaining Acceptance Gate

- Record a real mixed keyboard + mouse + controller macro in MacrosApp and confirm the saved event file contains `C|` controller rows.
- Restart MacrosApp and replay that mixed slot through vJoy; confirm output in `joy.cpl`.
- Load an AHK v1-recorded controller slot in MacrosApp and confirm controller playback maps through vJoy with no skipped-controller log messages.
- Temporarily run without vJoy available and confirm MacrosApp warns clearly while staying stable.
- After those manual checks pass, move this plan to `Plans/Completed/`.

## Solution / Scope

### E1 — Controller event recording (recommended first; simpler)

**Files:**
- `MacrosEngine/src/xinput_poller.c` — extend the polling loop to diff against previous `XINPUT_STATE` and emit `EVENT_CONTROLLER` records via `event_recorder.c` API
- `MacrosEngine/include/macros_engine.h` — add new exports `Engine_StartControllerRecording`, `Engine_StopControllerRecording`, `Engine_IsRecordingController`
- `MacrosApp/MacrosApp/NativeEngine.cs` — add `Try*` wrappers for the new exports
- `MacrosApp/MacrosApp/MainForm.cs` — wire controller-record toggle into the UI (probably a checkbox or hotkey alongside the existing keyboard/mouse recorder)
- `MacrosApp/MacrosApp/RecordingInputHook.cs` — confirm no overlap with existing keyboard/mouse hook
- `MacrosEngine/test/test_engine.c` — add test cases bringing suite to ~52
- `MacrosApp/tools/MacrosApp.Smoke/Program.cs` — extend to exercise controller-record path

**Reuse:** AHK v1 `Macros.ahk:1616+` (`RecorderSampleController`) for the diff-and-emit reference; `Lib/XInput.ahk:204+` for the deadzone + quantization constants (deadzone 2500 thumb / 5 trigger; step 256 thumb / 4 trigger).

### E2 — vJoy playback (do after E1)

**Files:**
- `MacrosEngine/CMakeLists.txt` — add vJoy SDK header + library link (or LoadLibrary at runtime to allow optional dependency)
- `MacrosEngine/src/event_player.c:163` — replace the skip with vJoy device acquire + `SetBtn`/`SetAxis`/`SetContPov` calls
- `MacrosEngine/include/macros_engine.h` — add `Engine_GetVJoyState`, `Engine_SetVJoyDeviceId` exports
- `MacrosApp/MacrosApp/NativeEngine.cs` — corresponding `Try*` methods
- `MacrosApp/MacrosApp/MainForm.cs` — settings UI for vJoy device id + POV mode

**Reuse:** `Lib/VJoy_lib.ahk` (~865 LOC) has working device-id, POV-mode, axis-existence, and button-count handling. Mirror its behavior in C — same registry-based DLL discovery, same thumbstick / trigger axis mapping (`MapThumbAxis`, `MapTriggerAxis`).

### E3 — Cooperative playback-thread shutdown

**Files:**
- `MacrosEngine/src/event_player.c` — add a manual-reset event handle (`HANDLE g_player_cancel`); poll it in the main playback loop with `WaitForSingleObject(handle, 0)` between events; replace the `TerminateThread` fallback with `SetEvent(g_player_cancel)` followed by `WaitForSingleObject(thread_handle, timeout_ms)`
- `MacrosEngine/src/engine.c` — initialize/destroy the cancel event in `Engine_Init` / `Engine_Shutdown`
- `MacrosEngine/test/test_engine.c` — add a "shutdown during playback" stress test that asserts thread exits cleanly

**Reuse:** Standard Win32 cooperative-cancel pattern. No external code to mirror.

## When

Should be picked up after the user signs off on the post-2026-04-24 commit (Phase F of the debug session). E1 first (simpler, unblocks controller use cases). E2 second (depends on E1's controller-event flow being verified end-to-end). E3 can land in parallel with either since it's independent of the controller path.

Each item should be its own focused PR with: native test added, C# smoke coverage extended, manual test in `TESTING.md`, and a live-exercise note.

## Critical files

- `MacrosEngine/include/macros_engine.h`
- `MacrosEngine/src/xinput_poller.c`, `event_recorder.c`, `event_player.c`, `engine.c`
- `MacrosEngine/test/test_engine.c`
- `MacrosApp/MacrosApp/NativeEngine.cs`, `MainForm.cs`, `RecordingInputHook.cs`
- `MacrosApp/tools/MacrosApp.Smoke/Program.cs`
- Reference: `Macros.ahk` controller polling + `Lib/VJoy_lib.ahk`, `Lib/XInput.ahk`

## Verification

- E1: native test_engine suite ≥ 52/52 pass; smoke harness records controller event and reads it back; live-exercise on Xbox/PS4 controller and confirm event format compatibility with AHK v1 `macros_events/*.txt` files.
- E2: load an existing AHK-recorded slot containing controller events into MacrosApp, play back, observe vJoy device output (joy.cpl); confirm no events skipped.
- E3: kick off a long-running playback, call shutdown — observe thread exits within configured timeout, no `TerminateThread` log warning.

End-to-end test for the full set: record a 60-second mixed keyboard + mouse + controller macro in MacrosApp, save, restart MacrosApp, replay against vJoy — observe identical output to AHK v1.
