CONTROLLER RECORDING DEBUG INSTRUCTIONS
========================================

MAJOR IMPROVEMENTS MADE:
-------------------------
1. Controller combo (L1+L2+R1+R2+A) now properly suppresses itself from being recorded
2. 500ms grace period after pressing the combo prevents recording the button release
3. Controller hotkeys now mirror keyboard behavior:
   - L1+L2+R1+R2+A = Start/Stop recording (like F5/F6)
   - Start button = Toggle playback (like F12)
   - Start during playback = Pause/Resume
   - L1+L2+R1+R2+X = Kill switch (stop all macros)

I've also added debug output to diagnose why controller recording wasn't working.

WHAT TO TEST:
-------------

1. RELOAD THE SCRIPT (Ctrl+Esc)
   - You should see a tooltip immediately showing either:
     * "DEBUG: XInput initialized successfully" (GOOD)
     * "DEBUG: XInput FAILED to initialize" (BAD - XInput library not loading)

   If you see additional tooltips about DLLs:
     * "DEBUG: Found XInput DLLs: [list]" - Shows which DLLs were found
     * "DEBUG: Successfully loaded: [path]" - Which DLL actually worked
     * "DEBUG: No XInput DLLs found in system!" - XInput not installed
     * "DEBUG: Failed to initialize any XInput DLL!" - DLLs found but won't load

2. START CONTROLLER RECORDING
   - Press Ctrl+Shift+Alt+Z to open menu
   - Press F6 to start controller recording

   You should see one of these tooltips:
     a) "DEBUG: XInput NOT READY! Cannot record controller."
        → XInput failed to initialize - DirectX/XInput not properly installed

     b) "DEBUG: NO CONTROLLER DETECTED! Make sure controller is connected..."
        → XInput works but no controller is connected/recognized

     c) "DEBUG: Controller detected! Buttons: [number] - Starting recording..."
        → Controller IS detected! Recording should work.

3. WHILE RECORDING (if you got to step 2c)
   - Press buttons on your controller
   - Every 1 second you should see tooltips showing either:
     * "DEBUG: Controller state is EMPTY (sample [count])" - Lost controller
     * "DEBUG: Got controller state! Buttons: [number] (sample [count])" - Working!

   - When you press a button, you should see:
     * "DEBUG: First controller event recorded!" - First input captured
     * "DEBUG: Controller state change recorded! Total events: [count]" - More inputs

4. STOP RECORDING
   - Press F6 or Esc to stop
   - You should see:
     * "DEBUG: Recording stopped! Total events: [number] | Has controller events: [true/false]"

   The key info:
     - Total events should be > 0 if anything was recorded
     - Has controller events should be "1" or "true" if controller was captured

WHAT EACH ERROR MEANS:
----------------------

ERROR 1: "XInput FAILED to initialize"
  → PROBLEM: DirectX/XInput library not installed or accessible
  → FIX: Install DirectX End-User Runtime, or copy xinput1_3.dll or xinput1_4.dll
         to the script folder

ERROR 2: "NO CONTROLLER DETECTED"
  → PROBLEM: Controller not connected or not recognized as XInput device
  → FIX: Make sure controller is plugged in and shows up in Windows Game Controllers
         (joy.cpl). Some controllers need drivers or special software.
         If using PlayStation controller, you may need DS4Windows.
         If using non-XInput controller, it won't work with this script.

ERROR 3: "Controller state is EMPTY" during recording
  → PROBLEM: Controller disconnected or stopped responding during recording
  → FIX: Check USB connection, try different USB port, check if controller needs charging

ERROR 4: "Total events: 0" after recording
  → PROBLEM: Recording ran but captured nothing
  → FIX: Make sure you're actually pressing buttons during recording.
         Check if controller is in the right mode (some have XInput/DirectInput switch)

CONTROLLER REQUIREMENTS:
------------------------
- Must be an XInput-compatible controller (Xbox 360/One/Series controllers work natively)
- PlayStation controllers need DS4Windows or similar wrapper
- Generic controllers must support XInput (not just DirectInput)
- Must show up in Windows "Set up USB game controllers" (run joy.cpl)

If you need to test if your controller is XInput compatible, run joy.cpl in Windows
and check if your controller appears and responds to button presses.

After testing, report back what debug messages you see!
